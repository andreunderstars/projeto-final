# Hi there

This is the final project.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run start`.

## Commiting

Before committing any changes to the codebase, it is recommended to take the following steps:

1. Check formatting and linting with `npm run format` & `npm run lint`.
2. Ensure that your code is properly documented and any new functionality is covered in the app's documentation and automated tests.
3. Run `npx cz` to write your commit message.
